                <br>
                <p>In this project, I created a comprehensive bookstore management system using C++ that leverages object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. This system facilitates the operations of a bookstore, allowing for user management (buyers and sellers), and book operations (adding, buying, and deleting books). Below, I'll walk you through the key features and OOP concepts used in this project.</p>

                <h2>Overview of the System</h2>
                <p>The bookstore management system supports two main user types: sellers and buyers. Sellers can sign up, log in, add books, and delete books. Buyers can sign up, log in, and purchase books. The system uses file handling for persistent storage of user information and book inventory.</p>

                <h2>Key Classes and Their Roles</h2>
                <h5>Person Class</h5>
                <p>This is a base class used for inheritance. It contains protected attributes username and password, which are common to both buyers and sellers.</p>
                <p><strong>OOP Concept:</strong> Inheritance.</p>

                <h5>Cart Class</h5>
                <p>This class handles the shopping cart functionality for buyers. It includes methods to add books to the cart and display the cart contents.</p>
                <p><strong>OOP Concept:</strong> Encapsulation and Abstraction.</p>

                <h5>Seller Class</h5>
                <p>Inherits from Person and adds specific attributes and methods for sellers, such as signup(), login(), addBooksseller(), and deleteBooksseller().</p>
                <p><strong>OOP Concept:</strong> Inheritance and Encapsulation.</p>

                <h5>Buyer Class</h5>
                <p>Also inherits from Person and adds attributes like address details and methods such as signup(), login(), and buybooksbuyer().</p>
                <p><strong>OOP Concept:</strong> Inheritance and Encapsulation.</p>

                <h5>Book Class</h5>
                <p>Represents individual book objects with attributes like name, author, price, ISBN, and availabecopies.</p>
                <p><strong>OOP Concept:</strong> Encapsulation.</p>

                <h5>Category Class</h5>
                <p>An abstract class that provides a template for different book categories (Fiction and NonFiction). It declares pure virtual functions addBooks(), buyBooks(), and delBook().</p>
                <p><strong>OOP Concept:</strong> Abstraction and Polymorphism.</p>

                <h5>Fiction and NonFiction Classes</h5>
                <p>These classes inherit from Category and provide implementations for the pure virtual functions declared in Category.</p>
                <p><strong>OOP Concept:</strong> Inheritance and Polymorphism.</p>

                <h5>AllBooks Class</h5>
                <p>Contains instances of Fiction and NonFiction, representing the bookstore's complete inventory.</p>
                <p><strong>OOP Concept:</strong> Encapsulation.</p>

                <h5>Shop Class</h5>
                <p>Manages the overall bookstore operations, coordinating between buyers, sellers, and the inventory.</p>
                <p><strong>OOP Concept:</strong> Encapsulation and Abstraction.</p>

                <h2>OOP Concepts in Action</h2>
                <p>Encapsulation is used extensively across the classes to protect the data and expose only necessary functionalities. For instance, book details and user credentials are encapsulated within their respective classes.</p>
                <p>Inheritance allows for code reuse and logical hierarchy. The Person class serves as a base for Seller and Buyer, ensuring that common attributes and methods are inherited.</p>
                <p>Abstraction is achieved through the Category class, which provides a high-level interface for different book categories, hiding the implementation details.</p>
                <p>Polymorphism is employed through the use of virtual functions in the Category class, allowing Fiction and NonFiction to have different implementations for the same methods.</p>

                <h2>File Handling for Persistence</h2>
                <p>The system uses file handling to store and retrieve data, ensuring persistence across sessions. For instance, when a seller adds a book, it is saved to a file, and when a buyer logs in, their credentials are verified from a file.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>This bookstore management system demonstrates how OOP principles can be applied to create a robust and scalable application. By using encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism, the code is well-organized, easy to maintain, and extendable for future enhancements.</p>
